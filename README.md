# ðŸ”¢ Odd or Even Checker

A simple beginner-level Python program that checks whether a number entered by the user is odd or even.

## ðŸ“„ What It Does

- Asks the user to input a number
- Uses the modulo operator to determine if the number is odd or even
- Displays the result to the user

## ðŸ§  Skills Practiced

- `input()` function
- Type conversion (`str` to `int`)
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)
- Using the modulo operator (`%`)

## ðŸ§ª Example Output

```
Enter a number: 42
42 is an even number.

Enter a number: 99
99 is an odd number.
```

## ðŸš€ How to Run

```bash
python odd_or_even.py
```

Or run it in PyCharm by right-clicking the file and selecting **Run**.

This is a great exercise to understand how conditional logic works in Python. Feel free to expand it to check multiple numbers or handle invalid input!
